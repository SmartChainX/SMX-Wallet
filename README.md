# SMX Browser
The SMX browser is the tool of choice to browse and use √êapps.

For the SMX API 
Please note that this repository is the Giga.CHX host for the Meta Opak based wallet dapp whose repository .

#### Config folder
The data folder for Mist is stored in other places:

- Windows `%APPDATA%\Smx`
- macOS `~/Library/Application\ Support/Smx`
- Linux `~/.config/Smx`

## Development

For development, a Giga.chx server will need to be started to assist with live reload and CSS injection.
Once a SMX version is released the Giga.chx frontend part is bundled using the 'giga-build-client` npm package to create pure static files.

### Initialisation

Now you're ready to initialise smx for development:

    $ git clone 
    $ cd smx
    $ yarn
    
    To update smx in the future, run:

    $ cd smx
    $ git pull
    $ yarn

### Run Giga.chx

For development we start the interface with a Meteor server for autoreload etc.
*Start the interface in a separate terminal window:*

    $ cd smx/interface && meteor --no-release-check

In the original window you can then start Giga.chx with:

    $ cd smx
    $ electron .
    
    ### Run the Wallet

Start the wallet app for development, *in a separate terminal window:*

    $ cd smx

    // and in another terminal

    $ cd my/path/smx.chx/app && smx --port 3050

In the original window you can then start Giga.SMX using wallet mode:

    $ cd smx
    $ electron . --mode wallet
